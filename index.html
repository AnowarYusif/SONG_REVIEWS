                    <p>The first review will be a song by my favorite artists.</p>
                    <p>The first song i want to review is Adonai by Sarkodie.
                        This song was released 9years ago by the most decorated rapper in Africa, Sarkodie.
                        He featured castro who is also a ghanaian highlife singer. 
                        Unfortunately,castro was never seen again after he drowned in the ADA river some years ago.
                        This is the ghanaian song with the most youtube views. Watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipZvlG-wwWk">here</a>.
                    </p>

                    
                    
                    <h3><a href="song_review2.html">Song Review 2</a></h3>
                    <p>The second review will be a song from a random artist.</p>
                    <p>Next on the review is another great song by one of the fast rising ghanaian artist, Blacksherif.
                        He came into the spotlight 2 years ago and he has being killing it ever since.
                         One of my fav songs by him is Second Sermon.Watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFdD3Y8mqPI">here</a>
